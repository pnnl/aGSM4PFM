## **Overview**
This repository provides a high-performance numerical solver leveraging the [Gradient Smoothing Method (GSM)](https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/13508#t=aboutBook), integrated with adaptive remeshing of structured meshes, for efficient Phase Field modeling of interface dynamics.  

### Key Features:
- **Second-Order Accuracy:** Achieves general 2nd-order accuracy across computations.  
- **Linear Computational Complexity:** Scales as **O(N)**, meaning runtime increases linearly with the number of elements.  
- **Superior Performance:** Outperforms weak-form Finite Element Method (FEM)-based software, including adaptive mesh approaches.  
- **Efficient for Large-Scale Problems:** Exhibits significant advantages over uniform structured strong-form Finite Difference Methods (FDM), especially for thin interfaces or large-scale simulations.
